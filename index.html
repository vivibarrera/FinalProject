<h1>My Final Project Proposal</h1>
<p>Come december first finishing up our last sprint I plan on creating a 
    python program that automates Excel with Python</p>
<h1>Title of my project: Excel loves PY </h1>

<body style="background-color:rgb(25, 156, 95);">
    <h1>user end perspective:</h1>
    <p>By automating an excel workbook with python it will allow the user to load workbooks, modify sheet names, look at cell values, merge cells and even style them
        . As someone who works in a data entry position at an insurance firm I use excel very often to create data reports and by automating my wrokbooks with python it 
        can make my work easier and more organized. 
    </p>
<h1>Technology Overview</h1>
<p> 1. I will be using PYTHON which requires visual studio code and my terminal (powershell)</p>
